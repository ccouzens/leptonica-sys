# leptonica-sys

Rust FFI bindings to [Leptonica](http://www.leptonica.org/).

Types and functions generated from the functions listed in
[allheaders.h](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/master/src/allheaders.h).

## Building

This links to the C library Leptonica.

On Fedora 30 the build dependencies can be installed by running:

```bash
sudo dnf install leptonica-devel clang
```

On Termux 2019 (Android, Android on Chromebooks) the additional dependencies can be installed by running:

```bash
pkg install libclang leptonica-dev
```

### Building on Windows
    
On Windows, this library uses Microsoft's [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to provide leptonica.
    
Please install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) and **set up user wide integration** or [vcpkg crate](https://crates.io/crates/vcpkg) won't be able to find a library.
By default vcpkg installs 32 bit libraries. If you need 64 bit libraries then set following environment variable

```cmd
SET VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET=x64-windows
```
To install leptonica

```cmd
REM from the vcpkg directory
.\vcpkg install leptonica
```

vcpkg allows building either dynamically or statically linked application

if you prefer dynamic linking

```cmd
SET VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC=true
```

for statically linked libraries

```cmd
SET RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+crt-static
